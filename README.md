  #Description 

  The purpose for this application is creating a generator that makes a readme based on the users input. The purpose of this assignment was to learn how to use node.js initially. I learned how to use switch cases, require, module.exports, and writetofile to create a series of questions that the user answers which generates the README based on their choice. This solves the problem of assisting the user of creating an application that can be built and unique with user interaction.

  #Installation

  What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
  In order to make an application similar to this would require installing node.js. Second, the user would use the commands node npm i, npm init, npm start, and node index.js. These commands are for installing the packages from https://www.npmjs.com/ and using the specific version. The node index.js is to check the command line is displaying what you want based on the code developed. 
  
  #Usage

  The screenshot below shows how to use this application.
 
  
  ##Contributing

  I used github for my repository, https://www.npmjs.com/ for the inquirer package, and the licenses from https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba.

  ##License
     
  The licenses I used for this application were Apache and Mit. I also included the choice of "NONE" for no license.   

  ##Tests
  
  The user can use a different package but will need to use const thePackageName = require('the package name'); to use the package.
  The questions in the switch case can be changed, the questions replaced to anything or additional authentication could be added.  For example, "Hello who are you?" or "What is your member id?".
  Node index.js would then be used to ensure the command line is working correctly with the changes made to the code. Other licenses can be added into the code if the user needs a different one.
